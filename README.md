# I want to contribute
That's great!

I recommend you read the next 3 paragraphs before starting.


## How exactly do I contribute code?
Here is a simple step by step guide to get you started.

1. Fork this repository
2. A copy of the repo is now available from your github-profile and can be cloned to your pc; so do that
3. Make some changes to your copy of the repository with the IDE/editor of your choice
4. Save the changes, make a _commit_ including some nice commit-message and then _push_ to your github
5. From your github-profile, navigate to your fork. An option to send a pull-request should appear based on your recent commits
6. After you have sent the pull-request, wait patiently for me to pull it in (merge it)


## What should I (as a newcomer) know about contributing to this project?
For now, we are doing most stuff in a single branch _main_.
However, new branches can be created if it suits your workflow.

There are no rules about what code you can and can not contribute, but maybe we will need a set of rules in the future.

If you are unsure about what you want to contribute then have a look at [issues](https://github.com/emilbratt/lonely-chess/issues) for stuff that might inspire you.


## I am bad at coding, would I be able to contribute?
This repository is meant for both beginners and advanced programmers.

No contribution is too small and _all_ contributions to the project are welcome.
The main goal here is to improve your collaborating skills.
Don't worry, improved coding skills is a by-product :).
